# üî• Exploring the Cornerstone of LLMs: Attention Mechanisms

## Why This Project?

Reading papers and analyzing code is enlightening, but nothing beats the experience of getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, and learning from them. With minimal external resources, I embarked on a journey to code the cornerstone of Large Language Models (LLMs): the attention mechanism. The process was an eye-opening experience, teaching me invaluable lessons along the way.

## üöÄ Self-Attention: The Foundation of Modern NLP

Self-Attention revolutionized Natural Language Processing by drawing inspiration from retrieval systems through Query, Key, and Value. The core idea is straightforward, yet its implications are profound.

### The Formula
At the heart of self-attention lies a simple yet powerful formula:
$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{D}}\right) V $$

### Why Divide by  $\sqrt{D}$ ?
The division by the square root of the dimensionality \(D\) stabilizes the gradients, ensuring that the inner product values remain within a manageable range during training.

### Looking Back, Not Forward
In autoregressive models like LLMs, the model is designed to only look backward, never forward. This is crucial because the model should not see the future‚Äîonly the past influences the next word generation. This constraint adds to the mystique and complexity of these models, mimicking the way humans process language.

## üêâ The Real Beast: Multi-Headed Attention

Multi-Headed Attention is where the true power of LLMs shines. By enabling parallelism, multiple queries can attend to various aspects of the text simultaneously, allowing the model to capture diverse patterns and meanings in a single pass.

### Grouped Query Attention: Reining the Beast

To further optimize and reduce compute latency, grouped query attention steps in. This technique clusters queries, reducing the computational overhead while maintaining the model's ability to attend to multiple aspects of the input efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
